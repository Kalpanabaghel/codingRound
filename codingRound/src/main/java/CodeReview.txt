#Code Review Comments

1) Redundancy of methods (Solution - Made a base class inclusing all frequently used methods such as findElement etc. )
2) Incorrect Locator at one place (Solution - Corrected the locator)
3) No Frame switching (Solution - Switched to frame before locating the element in the frame)
4) Incorrect POM implementation (Solution - Corrected the implementation)
